# ERCOT Grid Conditions Plugin

## Description

The Electric Grid in Texas has been growing increasingly unreliable creating a fair bit of anxiety anytime the weather does something abnormal (those things becoming far more normal these days). `ERCOT Grid Conditions Plugin` allows you to keep an eye on the realtime status of the Grid as reporting by ERCOT.

## Features

- Mirror data from ERCOT's [Grid Conditions Dashboard](https://www.ercot.com/gridmktinfo/dashboards/gridconditions) to a Stream Deck key

## Status

ALPHA - This plugin is not yet ready for prime time
The plugin basically works but needs some tweaking to be ready to beta usage. I have not been able to confirm the plugin's behavior in non-normal conditions and will be checking on things the next time there are issues.
The API referenced by the plugin is an Undocumented Public API and as such some educated assumptions have been made as to the meaning of the API contents.
